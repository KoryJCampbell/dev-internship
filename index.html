			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<p>Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our developer internship here at New Kind. It wasn't <em>that</em> long ago that I was in your shoes, eager to break into the web-world.</p>

			<p>It's my goal for our intern to learn a ton of practical, real-world skills and knowledge, so that you're ready to step right into a developer role either here at New Kind, or wherever it is you'd like to go in the world.</p>

			<p>Let's start learning now! I'm going to need you to go fork this repo on github to submit your response. Don't know how to do that yet? That's ok! This industry is full of learning every day, and your ability and willingness to pick up new skills is paramount in what we're looking for. Get your hands dirty! <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Here's a good place to start</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>To submit:</strong> Just zip up a copy of your code and email it to <a href="mailto:tech@newkind.com">tech@newkind.com</a>, or publish it wherever you like and send us a link. Please feel free to be as creative as you'd like with what you submit. Don't feel constrained by the styles/layout that I've built here. This is a great time to show off your design and development sensibilities and skills! We'll be accepting submissions until January 15.</p>

			<h2>Design Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Explain how design and development intersect. What role do you see a developer playing in the design process?</li>
				<!-- They both go hand in hand. As a developer, you aren't considered a "designer", but it is important to have basic design concepts in order to work well with your team. I really would like to strength my designing skills furthur, in addition to dev. skills. -->

				<li>Describe how grids are useful, and how you generally go about using them, or implementing them.</li>
				<!--Grids are useful because they allow you build a solid structure in your product. Grids are used to arrange content.	Some grid systems that are popular are Bootstrap, Materalize, etc. Implementing these are easy. With Bootstrap, you can download templates, or use the CDN and use it's components.  -->

				<li>Talk a little bit about pattern libraries and visual systems. What are they and how are they useful? Have you used them before?</li>
				<!--I have never used pattern libraries or visual systems, however they are a collection of user interface design patterns. They give a consistency in UX.-->

			</ol>

We also were taught how to build a wordpress theme. Currently, I am searching for local clients and looking to build websites for them. -->

				<li>Is this your first time using version control? If not, tell us about other times you've used it, and which technologies.</li>
				<!--No, Git was taught to us as our primary version control system and we use it pretty much everyday. -->

				<li>Do you have experience with CSS pre-processors? Which one do you prefer and why?</li>
				<!--Yes, I have use SASS, and briefly looked over LESS. I prefer SASS because I have done more development work with it. -->

				<li>What is your comfort level with responsive design? Have you done any mobile-first projects before? Tell us about what you know.</li>
